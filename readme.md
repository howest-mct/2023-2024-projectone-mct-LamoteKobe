**Projecttitel:** Zonne-energie monitor

This project is designed to help homeowners optimize their solar energy usage by monitoring the energy production from their solar panels and comparing it to their household's total energy consumption. When the demand for energy is high and the solar output is low or insufficient, non-critical devices (such as an electric car charger) will be automatically turned off to minimize the grid usage.
